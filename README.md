This is a fragment of a Unity-based platformer I began creating in my spare time in 2017. Nothing was ever really finished, but using a free assets library and some YT instruction, I was able to get some basic features working, included image-based level generation. Each level is stored in a file with each pixel representing one block. Transparent pixels represent empty space while each type of tile or character is generated by a specific color of pixel.
