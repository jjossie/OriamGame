This is a fragment of a Unity-based platformer I began creating in my spare time in 2017. Nothing was ever really finished, but using a free assets library and some YouTube instruction, I was able to get some basic features working, included image-based level generation. Each level is stored as an image file with each pixel representing one tile. Transparent pixels represent empty space while each type of tile or character is generated by a specific color of pixel.
